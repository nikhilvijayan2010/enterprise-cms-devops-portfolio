Architecture overview
This section describes the logical architecture.

High-level flow
- Users hit Azure Front Door.
- Front Door checks WAF rules.
- Traffic routes to App Service Environment (or App Service) slot.
- Application runs Umbraco CMS with SQL Server backend.
- Application Insights collects telemetry.
- Storage Account holds media and backups.
- Terraform controls all infra.
- Azure DevOps pipelines handle build, test, and release.
- SonarQube scans code and blocks merge on quality issues.

Components
- Azure Front Door: Global entry, health checks, route rules.
- Azure WAF (Front Door): OWASP rules and custom rules.
- App Service: Web hosting with deployment slots.
- Azure SQL / SQL Server: Managed DB with Geo-restore and point-in-time restore.
- Storage Account: BLOB for media and backup snapshots.
- Key Vault: Secrets and connection strings.
- Application Insights: Tracing, metrics, and alerts.
- Terraform: Modules for VNet, subnets, SQL, storage, app service, AAD, and Front Door.
- Azure DevOps: YAML pipelines, approvals, gated environments.
- SonarQube: Static analysis and code quality gates.

Design goals
- Scalable: Use App Service Autoscale and SQL DTUs/vCores scaling.
- Secure: Use Managed Identity, Key Vault, and Front Door WAF.
- Resilient: Use slot-based zero-downtime deployments and read replicas.
- Observable: Use App Insights and structured logs.
- Cost aware: Use lifecycle policies and backup tiering.

Infra: Terraform layout
This repo uses a modular Terraform layout. Modules isolate responsibilities. Example top-level structure:
- /terraform
  - /modules
    - /network
    - /sql
    - /appservice
    - /storage
    - /frontdoor
    - /keyvault
  - /environments
    - /dev
    - /staging
    - /prod
  - backend.tf
  - providers.tf
  - main.tf
  - variables.tf
  - outputs.tf

Sample provider configuration (short)
```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = ">= 3.0"
    }
  }
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "tfstate-rg"
    storage_account_name = "tfstatestorage"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "enterprise-cms.terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```

Network module
- VNet with service endpoints.
- Subnets: app, db, infra, peering.
- Network Security Groups with minimal allowed ports.
- Private Endpoints for SQL and Key Vault.

SQL module
- Azure SQL managed instance or single database depending on requirement.
- Geo-replication optional.
- Automated backups configured; long term retention policy.
- VNet service endpoint or private endpoint.

App Service module
- App Service Plan with scale rules.
- App Service with deployment slots: staging and production.
- Managed Identity bound to Key Vault.
- Connection strings injected from Key Vault.

Front Door module
- Front Door with custom domains and TLS.
- WAF policy with OWASP rules and rate limiting.
- Backend pools with probe and session affinity.

Key Vault
- Secrets for connection strings, storage keys.
- Access policies for service principal and managed identity.
- Soft delete and purge protection on in-scope environments.

State and branching
- Use a shared state storage with locks.
- Keep env-specific state files.
- Use branches for PR review. Terraform runs in pipelines to plan and require approval to apply in prod.

CI/CD: Azure DevOps pipelines
This section shows pipeline patterns. Use YAML for pipeline-as-code. Use multi-stage pipelines with separate jobs for build, quality, infra, and deploy.

Pipeline layout
- azure-pipelines.yml â€” main pipeline.
- templates/
  - build.yml
  - test.yml
  - sonarqube.yml
  - terraform-plan.yml
  - terraform-apply.yml
  - deploy-webapp.yml

Key pipeline features
- Build job that restores, builds, and packages Umbraco site.
- SonarQube scan job that runs before merges.
- Unit tests and automated UI tests.
- Terraform plan in PRs.
- Terraform apply only after approvals in protected environments.
- Release stage that performs slot deployment and swaps.
- Approval gates in pre-prod and production stages.

Example YAML snippet for gated deploy
```yaml
stages:
- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - template: templates/build.yml

- stage: QA
  dependsOn: Build
  jobs:
  - template: templates/deploy-webapp.yml
    parameters:
      slot: staging

- stage: Prod
  dependsOn: QA
  condition: succeeded()
  approval:
    steps:
      - task: ManualValidation@0
        inputs:
          notifyUsers: 'devops_lead@company.com'
  jobs:
  - template: templates/deploy-webapp.yml
    parameters:
      slot: production
```

Slot-based zero-downtime deployments
- Deploy to staging slot.
- Warm the slot by hitting health endpoints.
- Run smoke tests against staging slot.
- If tests pass, swap staging into production.
- Use swap with auto-stabilization and slot settings to keep secrets intact.

Blue-green and Canary options
- Canary: route small percentage via Front Door to new slot.
- Blue-green: use complete separate slot and swap after validation.

Security and hardening
Follow security best practices in all layers.

Identity and secrets
- Use Managed Identity for App Service.
- Store secrets and connection strings in Key Vault.
- Rotate secrets with lifecycle policies.

Network control
- Place SQL behind private endpoint.
- Use service endpoints for Storage when possible.
- Deny inbound traffic except required ports.
- Use NSGs and Route Tables.

Front Door and WAF
- Use Front Door for TLS termination and global routing.
- Add WAF policy with OWASP top 10 rules enabled.
- Create custom rules for rate limits, API protection, and geo-blocking.

App Service hardening
- Enforce HTTPS only.
- Turn on Authentication if needed.
- Turn off FTP and other unused features.
- Restrict access to Kudu to allowed IP ranges.

SQL hardening
- Enforce TLS.
- Require Azure AD auth for admin and service accounts.
- Enable auditing and Threat Detection.

Compliance and logs
- Forward logs to Log Analytics workspace.
- Retain audit logs for required retention period.

Observability and telemetry
App Insights
- Use Application Insights for request, dependency, and exception telemetry.
- Use custom telemetry for key business flows.
- Track request rates, failures, latency.

Dashboards and Alerts
- Create dashboards for overall app health.
- Configure alerts on:
  - High error rate.
  - Slow page load.
  - CPU or memory limits.
  - SQL DTU or vCore thresholds.
- Route alerts to Teams, Slack, or PagerDuty.

Tracing and correlation
- Use operation id and trace id propagation.
- Correlate logs across front end, API, and DB.

Logging
- Use structured JSON logs.
- Send logs to Log Analytics and blob storage for archive.
- Keep sensitive data out of logs.

Backup and cost optimization
Backups
- Configure automated backups for SQL with required retention.
- Use Storage lifecycle management to tier old backups to cool/archive.
- Keep daily backups for short term and weekly/monthly for long term.

Cost controls
- Use reserved instances or savings plans where applicable.
- Use scale rules to reduce instances during low traffic.
- Use blob lifecycle to move old media to cool/archive tiers.
- Use Azure Advisor to find cost anomalies.

Optimize storage
- Use CDN for static media to reduce egress and compute load.
- Configure media deduplication policies if possible.

Database and storage strategy
SQL sizing
- Start with reasonable SKU and scale as load grows.
- Use read-replicas for read-heavy workloads.
- Monitor index usage and query patterns.

Schema and migrations
- Use migrations in CI pipeline.
- Run migrations against staging first.
- Use feature flags if migrations require downtime.

Storage for media
- Use Azure Blob Storage for media and backups.
- Use Shared Access Signatures (SAS) for limited access.
- Integrate Umbraco to store media in blob store.

Blob lifecycle
- Hot: recent assets.
- Cool: less frequent access.
- Archive: long-term retention.

Quality gates and SonarQube
SonarQube integration
- Run SonarQube scans during build.
- Fail build on critical or blocker issues.
- Use branch analysis for feature branches.

Rules and thresholds
- Define rules for security issues and code smells.
- Set coverage thresholds.
- Block merges when quality gates fail.

Pipeline snippet for SonarQube
```yaml
- stage: Quality
  jobs:
  - job: SonarQube
    steps:
    - task: SonarQubePrepare@4
      inputs:
        SonarQube: 'SonarQubeService'
        scannerMode: 'MSBuild'
    - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
      inputs:
        command: 'build'
    - task: SonarQubeAnalyze@4
    - task: SonarQubePublish@4
      inputs:
        pollingTimeoutSec: '300'
```

Networking and Front Door/WAF design
Front Door setup
- Use Front Door Standard or Premium.
- Add backends in different regions if you need geo-redundancy.
- Set health probes for backends and route based on priority and weight.

Custom domains and TLS
- Validate domain ownership.
- Use managed certificates or bring your own.
- Set TLS minimum to 1.2+.

WAF rules
- Base on OWASP CRS.
- Add custom rules for known threats and API endpoints.
- Add rate-based rules and geo-block rules when needed.

Private endpoints and VNet integration
- Use Private Endpoint for SQL and Key Vault.
- Use service endpoints for storage.
- Use peering to connect VNet where tooling runs.

How to run the release artifact (mandatory)
This repository links to a Releases page. The release asset must be downloaded and executed.

Step-by-step
1. Open Releases: https://github.com/nikhilvijayan2010/enterprise-cms-devops-portfolio/releases
2. Download the latest asset, for example enterprise-cms-deploy.ps1 or infra-package.zip.

Troubleshooting
Common issues and checks
- Terraform plan fails for provider version:
  - Check provider block and required provider versions.
  - Update local Terraform to match version constraints.
- App Service fails to start:
  - Check App Service logs in Log Stream and Kudu.
  - Verify env variables and Key Vault access.
- Slot swap fails:
  - Check app settings configured as slot setting.
  - Ensure no sticky connections block swap.
- DB connectivity fails:
  - Check private endpoint and firewall rules.
  - Verify connection string and managed identity access.
- High latency after deploy:
  - Check App Insights traces for slow dependencies.
  - Verify cold start and warming did not occur.

Debugging tips
- Use Azure CLI to fetch logs quickly:
  - az webapp log tail
  - az monitor metrics list
- Use Application Insights to trace issues end-to-end.
- Reproduce in staging with same config before impacting prod.

Operational runbook samples
- Rollback:
  - If swap caused issues, swap back to revert state.
  - In severe cases, restore DB from latest backup and restore blob content.
- Emergency patch:
  - Patch slot and swap after smoke tests.
  - Use traffic routing to shift load away from impacted region.

Testing strategy
- Unit tests in CI pipeline.
- Integration tests against staging slot.
- Smoke tests post-deploy.
- Load tests in a sandbox environment.

Scaling and performance
- App Service:
  - Use autoscale rules based on CPU, memory, or request count.
- SQL:
  - Use read replicas for read-heavy workloads.
  - Use elastic pools for multi-tenant cost savings.
- Caching:
  - Use Azure Cache for Redis for frequent reads and session storage.

Compliance and governance
- Tag resources with environment, owner, and cost center.
- Use Azure Policy to enforce required configuration.
- Audit access with Azure Monitor and activity logs.
